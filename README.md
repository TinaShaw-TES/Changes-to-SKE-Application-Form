# Changes-to-SKE-Application-Form
Changes required to AO application per attached...
Can you help me with issues with the AO application form? There are some confusing aspects causing applicants to be put of form applying or applying for things that don’t exist – this is particularly important for our International applicants.

Assessment Only application form edits:
1.	Professional Skills tests
International applicants think that these still exist as there is no explanation that these have stopped. 2019 skills tests will not expire until 3 years (AY 21-22) so we must amend this text to:
Non-expired Professional Skills tests or Fundamental Assessments in Maths and English

2.	On the menu of age range options it is possible to click on, for example, age range 3-7 years and add a specialist subject which is not permitted for age ranges: 3-7, 5 – 11 and 7 – 11. 
Please remove the option to add a subject to these primary phase age ranges
It must be possible for the 7 -14 years age range

I’d be grateful for help please.
best
Mikki
